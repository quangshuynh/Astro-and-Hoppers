# Astro & Hoppers Game

I worked on the Astro game

**Astro game** is a 2D puzzle game inspired by ThinkFun's *Lunar Landing*. This project was developed as part of a group effort from March to April 2024. It uses JavaFX for a graphical user interface (GUI) and a plain text user interface (PTUI) to provide a flexible and modular experience
